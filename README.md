# AR-project
If the scene doesn't pop up in the unity editor when cloning the repository, just put the object/scene named AR-Pokemon in the scene.
If you have the apk, connect your phone through cable to the device where the apk is located and enable USB debugging on your phone,
open the phone's storage on the device it is connected to and just drag and drop the apk there.
Next, go to the file manager application of your phone and just click it
It will maybe ask you to enable downloads from that application, and I promise it is not a virus so just enable it and it should run.
Have fun, playing
